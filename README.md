# Cross-ILC methods paper

## Paper:
* ....

## Overview:
* Cross-ILC technique:
  * For kSZ: Compute cross-spectrum between tSZ-free and CIB-free ILC maps to measure the kSZ power spectrum.
  * For CMB lensing: Pass tSZ-free and CIB-free ILC maps in the two legs of lensing quadratic estimator to mitigate both tSZ and CIB-induced lensing biases.
